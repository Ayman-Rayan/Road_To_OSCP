# Road_To_OSCP

In this repository im uploading and documenting all the Boxes that i performed a Pentest on in order to put in 
practice all the theory that i Learned from CISSP,CCNA,Pentest+,Ejpt and OSCP beginner course on tryhackme 

**the main goal of this serie is developing the required skills and reflexes to perform a professional Penetration 
Test by following the 5 stages of the Pentest**

##Stage1: Passive Reconaissance (Physical/social)
       - this stage is about information gathering that doesn't involve the host 

##Stage2: Scanning and enumeration 
       - on this stage we start an active reconaissance which means we scan the host and we try to map our victim network 
       to find the open ports and vulns that we can exploit through 
       
##Stage3: Gaining access
       - once we find the vulnerability through the enumeration Stage comes the exploiting stage , its the main payload and tool
       used to perform the exploit 

##Stage4: Maintaining access
       - once we are in the victim system we need to maintain access to peform our post exploitations procedures 
       for example we can lose the shell if it is unstable or if they reboot the machine 
       
##Stage5: Covering tracks
       - once u have succesfully peformed the 4 stages of the pentest , u should clean up any executables u used from 
       the host machine same thing for backdoors and more ...
